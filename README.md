![Data Salary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23350465-7854-481d-a2f9-10f48368e1e7)

The goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project is to gain a deeper understanding of the data science salary landscape. The analysis aims to answer questions such as:
What is the distribution of data science salaries, and what are the average salary ranges?
Which factors, such as location, industry, level of experience, and programming languages, have the greatest impact on salary levels?
Are there any correlations between salary and other variables, such as education level or job title?
How do data science salaries vary across different regions and countries?

To answer these questions, we will perform a comprehensive analysis of the data science salary dataset, which includes information on:
Salary levels
Location (city, state, country)
Industry (finance, healthcare, technology, etc.)
Level of experience (entry-level, mid-level, senior-level)
Programming languages (Python, R, SQL, etc.)
Education level (Bachelor's, Master's, Ph.D.)
Job title (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, etc.)

The analysis will involve a range of techniques, including:
Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data
Distribution analysis to understand the shape and characteristics of the salary data
Correlation analysis to identify relationships between salary and other variables
Visualization of results using plots and charts to communicate findings and insights

By performing this analysis, we hope to gain a better understanding of the data science salary landscape and provide insights that can inform decision-making for data scientists, hiring managers, and organizations looking to attract and retain top talent in the field.

Overview:

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the distribution of data science salaries and identify factors that affect salary levels. The analysis includes:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Distribution analysis of salary data
Correlation analysis of salary with other variables
Visualization of results using plots and charts

Key Findings:
The average salary for data scientists is $118,000 per year.
Salaries are highest in the United States, with an average salary of $140,000 per year.
The most common programming languages used by data scientists are Python, R, and SQL.
The most common industries for data scientists are finance, healthcare, and technology.

Libraries Used:
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy for numerical computations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks
